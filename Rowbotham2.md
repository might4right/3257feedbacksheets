**Other comments:**

* Effective delivery style; very practical and you provided good examples to illustrate what farmers have to deal with come milking time.
* The structure of your introduction was a little confusing, with the blank screen at the beginning and then introducing some background info before the title slide. You could have done this after the title slide as well while maintaining structural integrity.
