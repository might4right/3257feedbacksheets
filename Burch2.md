**Other comments:**

* YES to everything. Just yes.
* For me at least, the strongest con you had was a lack of compromise and an increase of gridlock. I've personally experienced just how polarized we are as not just a "body politic," but a culture.
* Good use of the assertion evidence point and verbal headings.
* Your slide with the dot matrix charts (from WaPo) was perhaps the most engaging and relatable of your visuals. 
* "Educated" can be quite a relative term, based on each voter's underlying ideology and experience.
* Your delivery was effective, but if I had to suggest anything to improve it, it would be to slow it down just a tad. The two-party system is a simplistically complicated issue and many of us, myself included, have not fully engaged with it.
