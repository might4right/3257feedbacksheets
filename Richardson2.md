**Other comments:**

* Full marks for great use of the assertion evidence format. Oil policies are a topic that largely go over my head, even with a strong biological background. Your slide design did a great job to define the problem and simplify the underlying science.
* What safety/regulatory concerns are there with the adoption of *A. borkumensis*?
