**Other comments:**

* Your visuals were engaging, but include a few that are more clear and specific to your topic. Visual learners, myself among them, don't just want to hear your assertions; they want to see them, too.
* On a similar line, don't be afraid to explicitly put your assertions on your slides (Nathan touched on this earlier.)
* Good work; with your steady eye contact it seemed clear you were passionate about your topic. Don't be afraid to vary your tone, and be careful reg. your use of vocal fillers.
