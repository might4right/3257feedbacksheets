**Other comments:**

* Good job using the assertion-evidence format.
* It was interesting that you decided to conduct your own survey for the presentation. Perhaps give us more details into your methodology. How many students did you survey?
* Don't be afraid to slow down your delivery to protect its flow. Sometimes your transitioning between slides was a little abrupt.
