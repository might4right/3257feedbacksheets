**Other comments:**

* Good use of data; you explained each table well and made them as convincing as possible.
* Your delivery flowed well and you provided solid transitions in between each of your slides/data points.
* VERY STRONG conclusion. "To mitigate the problem requires a little cost" tapped into my pathos, and you explained well that overpasses would be worth that cost.
