**Other comments:**

* Good job providing background information. 
* A great way to clinch your audience, maybe even during your introduction, would be to **show** us (not just tell us) something cool VR can do right from the beginning. (Virtual Speech was a fantastic example - perhaps use that.)
* Show us through your delivery that you stand by your assertions. You were swaying throughout the presentation, which I interpreted as nervousness.
