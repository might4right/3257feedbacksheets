**Other comments:**

* Your use of visuals was already effective, but what made it really work was your explicit focus on a few of the elements in the bar chart.
* The internship requirement is an interesting idea, but I didn't know that was what you were proposing until your last slides. Perhaps allude to it earlier in the presentation to preserve a good outline of your structure.
* You don't discuss much on classroom design after your introduction. Aside from the internship requirement, do you think that changing class design and delivery are also a part of your solution for the long term?
* Consider removing the borders around your slides (difficult, I know, it's a design template;) it can distract from the strength of your slide titles.
